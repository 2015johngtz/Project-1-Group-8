# Project-1-Group-8

## Description

This project was a collaborative effort to put forth a site that would allow the user to search for the crime rate in their zip code area. It was created using JQuery and Bulma CSS Styling, which was still a big learning process for our collective group. We faced multiple challenges throughout this process, but using our combined skills, we were able to work through almost all of the site's issues. Using the combined API's and properly pulling data from each of them using one click event was a trial, as well as showcasing the data pulled. We also had a hard time working with local storage, so the user could pull previous searches information with just a click. We worked through every single problem our site brought us with ease, and together we are proud to say that this safety security site has exceeded our expectations on how far we could go with it. We're still learning, though, so we hope with time, extensive googling, and expertise, we can come back to this project and add on to an already great site. We hope this site help anyone looking for a safer home!

To use our site: Click on the empty search bar, input whichever zip code you would like to see the crime rate and zillow options for, then hit enter or click search. The site will post the Crime Breakdown at the top of the page, under the navigation bar. It will also post the zillow listings for available houses in that area. If you would like to search a previous zip code again, simply look toward the Recent Zip Codes column that is holding the previous searches, and click the zip code you would like to see the information for.
